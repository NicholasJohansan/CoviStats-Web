# CoviStats (Web Version)
> note: a better readme file will be made in the future

This is a web version of [CoviStats Desktop](https://github.com/NicholasJohansan/CoviStats-Desktop), which is re-made with TailwindCSS and TypeScript instead, 
with plans to use Framer Motion for animations in the future. This was made to try out the aforementioned technologies, and also as a practice for responsive design, 
as well as try out making a dark/light mode toggle.
